# Collegestion
(An effective managing system) 
### Problem Defintion
In the modern era it becomes quite necessary that the interaction between an organization and its substructure along with the customers reflects itself in an efficient manner,with the present advanced technologies around it becomes quite effective to raise up the barriers of distance but what will make it more effective will be dealing with the space complexity issues apart from getting our conventional eye over the time complexity as there is a tradeoff between so in our present corporate project we will try to balance both equally.

The project particularly gives rises to a self innovated CRM system,the modification being it gives way to both customers as well as inter organisational members,which not only works out with the clients but the other way as well,being a collaborative CRM at roots we'll try it to be operational alongside as well. 

### Outcomes:
The outcome expected would be a viable interface storing the data as well as reflecting it in a dual input to single outcome format,which will be beneficial in an organisation for its smooth working with apt storage techniques,to be developed in a pliable format by the period of expected completion.
